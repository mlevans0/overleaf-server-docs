Tracks changes in binary files, which is unsupported in the legacy system.
There is support for labelled versions.
The system is in general more robust, there is less chance of data loss.

After upgrading your instance all new projects will be using Full Project History by default (unless opting-out, see environment variables in [Configuring Overleaf](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki/Configuring-Overleaf)). Existing projects will continue using the legacy History system, until theyâ€™re migrated.

[Full Project History migration instructions](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki/Full-Project-History-Migration).

This release also ships with official support for S3 compatible object storage. This could either be a self-hosted solution, like min.io or ceph.io, or AWS S3. The S3 based storage backend can optionally replaces the local fs/NFS storage backend. You can find a wiki page on [setting up S3 in Server Pro](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki/S3) and another wiki page describes the [migration process](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki/S3-Migration) for moving existing data into S3. With S3-compatible object storage support we prepared Server Pro for horizontal scaling, look out for news here soon!

### Bugfixes ###

- Remove empty "Advanced" tab in admin panel.

### Other changes ###

- Added cleanup scripts to flush redis data on container shutdown. This might increase the time it takes to stop the instance to up to 1 minute. If you're not using the Overleaf Toolkit, you need to [specify the timeouts in your container configuration](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/pull/1090/files).
- German translation coverage significantly improved ([d5d3fcd](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/commit/d5d3fcda472249d5c5bf6b74f0548f4f4700ee80))

### Bugfixes ###
- Fix parsing of `authnContext` in `passport-saml` options (Server Pro).
- Fix disconnect users option in site admin panel (Server Pro).

### Other changes ###

## Server Pro 3.0.1 ##

Release date: 2021-10-05

Image ID: `5e87b3c5ad41` (Community Edition Image ID: `9155d8a13aaa`)

This major release includes migrations that update the database in a backwards incompatible format. **Please ensure you have a [database backup](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki/Data-and-Backups) before upgrading**, in case of roll-back you will not be able to read data in the new format.

This update brings general performance and stability improvements to the application, along with many small improvements and bugfixes. 

We've recently updated the way we tag our docker images. In addition to `3.0.1`, we're also tagging the new version as `3` and `3.0`, representing the latest major and minor versions for the `3.x.x` branch respectively. These new tags will be updated again when a new minor or hotfix version is published.

`latest` tag won't be immediately updated to this new major version. If you're using a `docker-compose.yml` please update your `image` tag to `3`, `3.0` or `3.0.1`. [Toolkit](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit) users can continue using the [`bin/upgrade`](https://github.com/overleaf/toolkit/blob/master/doc/upgrading.md) script as usual.

**Important**: before upgrading to this new major version you need to upgrade to version `2.7.1` first.

## Troubleshooting ##

### Duplicate Keys ###

A migration may occasionally fail due to unexpected duplicate entries in a mongo collection.

#### Duplicate keys in tags collection ####

If upgrading from `2.7.1` to `3.0.1` fails with messages containing `MongoError: Error during migrate "20190912145029_create_tags_indexes": E11000 duplicate key error collection: sharelatex.tags index: user_id_1_name_1 dup key: {<â€¦>}` this means that one of your users has multiple tags/folders with the same name.

To recover, revert to your `2.7.1` backups and ask the user to make their tag/folder names unique. (The user id and specific tag name will be reported in the error message, so you can contact the affected user and mention the specific tag name that is problematic.) Then attempt the upgrade again.

You can also attempt to detect multiple tags in advance, before you upgrade, with the following aggregate:

```
docker exec -it mongo mongo
use sharelatex

db.tags.aggregate([
  {$group: {
    _id: {name: "$name", user_id: "$user_id"},
    count: {$sum: 1}
  }},
  {$match: {count: {$gt: 1}}},
  {$sort: {count: -1}}
])
```
If it returns no results, there are no duplicate tags, and the migration should succeed.

#### Duplicate keys in contacts collection ####

If you see the error `MongoError: Error during migrate "20190912145001_create_contacts_indexes": E11000 duplicate key error collection: sharelatex.contacts index: user_id_1 dup key{<â€¦>}` this indicates a similar problem in the `contacts` collection.  You can check how many entries are affected with the following command:

```
docker exec -it mongo mongo
use sharelatex

db.contacts.aggregate([
  {$group: {
    _id: {user_id: "$user_id"},
    count: {$sum: 1}
  }},
  {$match: {count: {$gt: 1}}},
  {$sort: {count: -1}}
])
```
The contacts collection is a cache of names which appear as completions in the "Share Project" modal, it is not critical data.
You can remove individual duplicate entries with the command

```
db.contacts.deleteOne({ "user_id" : ObjectId("...") })
```

where the ObjectId value should be taken from the list of duplicates.  When the duplicate contacts have been removed, the migration should succeed.  

### SAML initialisation error ###

You might see a `cert is required` error when upgrading from Server Pro `2.6.2` or earlier if `SHARELATEX_SAML_CERT` [is not provided](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf/wiki/Server-Pro:-SAML-Config#passing-keys-and-certificates).

If you come across the issue, please add the `SHARELATEX_SAML_CERT` value, and update your instance to `2.7.1` before attempting to upgrade to `3.x.x`.
