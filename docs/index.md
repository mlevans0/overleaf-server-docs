## Welcome

Welcome to the technical documentation for Overleaf Community Edition and [Overleaf Server Pro](https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises)! This comprehensive guide is designed to provide you with an in-depth understanding of the features, configuration options, and best practices for managing and utilizing Overleaf's collaborative writing and publishing platform within your own infrastructure.

Overleaf is a powerful tool that facilitates collaborative authoring and publishing of LaTeX documents. The Community Edition and Server Pro versions allow organizations to host their own instances of Overleaf, providing enhanced control, security, and customization over the platform's capabilities.

Whether you're an administrator setting up Overleaf for your organization or a user looking to leverage its collaborative features for document creation, this documentation will walk you through the necessary steps to install, configure, and utilize Overleaf Community Edition and Server Pro effectively.

## What is the difference between Overleaf Community Edition and Overleaf Server Pro?

Overleaf has two on-premise solutions - Overleaf Community Edition and Overleaf Server Pro.

The Overleaf Community Edition is a lite version of our LaTeX editing platform which can be freely self-installed see [https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf](https://github.com/overleaf/overleaf) for details; and Overleaf Server Pro is our full, officially supported, premium service. Overleaf Server Pro is an excellent option for enterprise organizations that are looking for the ease and functionality of the Overleaf platform, but require full control of the infrastructure in which the application runs.

Overleaf Server Pro comes as a Docker container and is a drop in replacement for Overleaf Community Edition. Overleaf Server Pro includes features such as SSO provided via LDAP and SAML2, improved security so users can not access the host machine, track changes, comments, our optimized version of TexLive, visual editor mode, templates and admin panel. You can find more information about Overleaf Server Pro for enterprise [here](https://www.overleaf.com/for/enterprises).

    We recommend enterprise organizations begin with Overleaf Community Edition to familiarize themselves with the platform's requirements and ensure a smooth experience before considering an upgrade to Overleaf Server Pro.
